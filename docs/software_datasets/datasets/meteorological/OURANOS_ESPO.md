| **Description** | Developed by Ouranos, a Canadian consortium on regional climatology and adaptation to climate change, the ESPO-G6-R2 dataset comprises daily climate projections from January 1950 to December 2100. Covering North America at a 10 km resolution, it includes multiple General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs, scenarios, ensemble members, and variables. The dataset is used in climate research and adaptation planning. |

The dataset is composed of daily timeseries of three variables: daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and daily precipitation. Data are available from 1950 to 2100 over North America. The simulation ensemble is comprised of 14 models driven by two emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0). In this paper, we describe the workflow used for the bias-adjustment, which relies on the detrended quantile mapping method and the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS) v2.1 reference dataset. Using the framework defined in the VALUE project, we show the improvements made by the bias-adjustment on marginal, temporal and multivariate aspects of the data. We also verify that the bias-adjusted climate data have similar climate change signal to the original climate model simulations. Finally, we provide guidance to users on how to use this dataset.}<br>}</pre> |
