| **Description** | NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 provides global downscaled climate scenarios derived from CMIP6 models. It includes daily projections of maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (~25 km x 25 km) for the periods from 1950 through 2100. The dataset is designed to assist in evaluating climate change impacts at local to regional scales. |

The archive contains downscaled historical and future projections for 1950â€“2100 based on output from Phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The downscaled products were produced using a daily variant of the monthly bias correction/spatial disaggregation (BCSD) method and are at 1/4-degree horizontal resolution. Currently, eight variables from five CMIP6 experiments (historical, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) are provided as procurable from thirty-five global climate models.}<br>}</pre> |
