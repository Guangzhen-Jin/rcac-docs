|--------|-------|
| **Description** | Daymet offers daily surface meteorological data for North America, including variables such as temperature, precipitation, and radiation. Spanning from January 1980 to December 2022, it provides data at a 1 km spatial resolution. The dataset supports ecological, hydrological, and agricultural research. |

| **Usage Policy** | All Daymet data are publicly available, without restriction, according to the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Data Use Policy. A NASA Earthdata Login account is generally required to download data.  Users should cite the dataset (authors, version, DOI) when using the data. The data are distributed in CF-compliant netCDF format via web services (THREDDS, OPeNDAP), pre-packaged files, and web APIs (e.g. single-pixel access). The data are labelled as ‚Äúprovisional and subject to revision‚Äù (i.e. there may be future updates or corrections). For third-party or embedded content (e.g. images or materials not produced by Daymet/ORNL), additional permission may be needed where not covered by standard NASA / ORNL terms. The ORNL DAAC also supports standard web service and geospatial protocols (e.g. OGC WMS/WCS) for visualization and subset download.  |
