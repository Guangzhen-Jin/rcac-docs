# Hydrological Datasets

Hydrological datasets provide observations and model-based estimates of river discharge, watershed characteristics, and hydrologic variables such as runoff, baseflow, and storage. These data are used in research on hydrology, water resources, and landâ€“atmosphere interactions.

To access the datasets on RCAC clusters:
```bash
$ module avail
$ module load datasets
$ module load datasets/hydrological
```

Each dataset module sets environment variables (e.g., $DATASET_PATH, $DATASET_DOCS, or $DATASET_<NAME>) that simplify access from your jobs and workflows.
