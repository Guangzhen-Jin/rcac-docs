## Description

Conda is an open-source, cross-platform, language-agnostic package manager and environment management system. It was originally developed to solve package management challenges faced by Python data scientists, and today is a popular package manager for Python and R. At first, Anaconda Python distribution was developed by Anaconda Inc.; later, it was spun out as a separate package, released under the BSD license. The Conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda, Miniconda, and Anaconda Repository. Conda is a NumFOCUS affiliated project.
