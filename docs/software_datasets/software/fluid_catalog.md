# Fluid Dynamics

Fluid dynamics is the study of how liquids and gases move and interact. From predicting the path of hurricanes to optimizing jet engines, these problems involve solving billions of equations that describe fluid flow. RCAC HPC resources make it possible to run large-scale simulations at high resolution, enabling breakthroughs in science and engineering.
