# Computational Chemistry

Computational chemistry uses physics-based models and simulations to understand chemical systems at the atomic scale. Solving these problems requires enormous computational power, since even small molecules involve solving equations with hundreds of interacting electrons. HPC systems enable accurate quantum chemistry calculations, large-scale molecular dynamics, and advanced simulations in areas such as drug discovery, materials science, and energy research.
